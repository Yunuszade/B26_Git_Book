Jack London’s output, typically hastily written, is of uneven literary quality, though his highly romanticized stories
of adventure can be compulsively readable. His Alaskan novels The Call of the Wild (1903), White Fang (1906), and
Burning Daylight (1910), in which he dramatized in turn atavism, adaptability, and the appeal of the wilderness, are
outstanding. His short story “To Build a Fire” (1908), set in the Klondike, is a masterly depiction of humankind’s
inability to overcome nature; it was reprinted in 1910 in the short-story collection Lost Face, one of many such volumes
that London published.

In addition to Martin Eden, he wrote two other autobiographical novels of considerable interest: The Road (1907) and
John Barleycorn (1913). Other important novels are The Sea-Wolf (1904), which features a Nietzsche superman hero,
Humphrey Van Weyden, who battles the vicious Wolf Larsen; and The Iron Heel (1908), a fantasy of the future that is
a terrifying anticipation of fascism.
